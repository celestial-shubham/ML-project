## Heart-Disease Prediction

* This notebook looks into using various python-based machine Learning and data science libraries in an attempt to build a machine learning model capable of predicting whether or   not someone has heart Disease based on their medical attributes

* Following steps for problem solving:

1. Problem definition
2. Data
3. Evaluation
4. features
5. Modelling
6. Experimentation

### Problem definition

Given clinical parameters about a patient ,can we predict whether or not they have heart Disease ?
